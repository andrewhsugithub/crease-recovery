## How To Use

1. git clone the repo and create .env file and add your clipdrop api key (see .env.sample)
2. put your pic (note: only .jpg files) in the sources folder
3. if your pic is sort of complex like many objects in a pic, then run the uncrease_with_background notebook otherwise run the uncrease notebook (suggestion: if you got a clothes pic run the uncrease notebook for a better result)
